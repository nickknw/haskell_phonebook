Haskell Phonebook
=================

I wanted to write a small project with pretty limited scope to help myself learn and practice Haskell.

This is a very good starter project listed by [this nice fellow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2284425/what-are-ten-really-good-short-programs-you-can-write-to-help-become-fluent-with/2284582#2284582).

The requirements are roughly as follows:

* Generate a list of 5,000 random names of people and generate 0 to 3 random phone numbers for each person.
    * Write something which, when given a person's last name, will find all the people with that last name.
    * Write something which, when given a person's phone number, will find the person.
    * Given a person, find all their phone numbers.
